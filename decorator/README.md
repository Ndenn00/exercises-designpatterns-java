# Decorator Pattern

Consider the typical example of a graphical window. To extend the functionality of the graphical window for example by adding a frame to the window, would require extending the window class to create a FramedWindow class. 
To create a framed window it is necessary to create an object of the FramedWindow class. However it would be impossible to start with a plain window and to extend its functionality at runtime to become a framed window.
